## Design Principles for Granula Gamification

### 1. **Progressive Disclosure**
Don't overwhelm new users with all gamification features at once. Introduce:
- Week 1: Streaks and basic XP
- Week 2: Badges and levels
- Week 3: Leaderboards and challenges
- Week 4: Advanced insights and communities

### 2. **Contextual Relevance**
Gamification should enhance, not distract:
- Students: Focus on learning mastery and study habits
- Professionals: Career advancement and work-life balance
- Freelancers: Revenue tracking and business growth

### 3. **Intrinsic > Extrinsic**
Prioritize meaningful rewards:
- ✅ Progress toward personal goals
- ✅ Skill development
- ✅ Career advancement evidence
- ❌ Arbitrary points with no meaning

### 4. **Cultural Adaptation**
Consider African context:
- Offline-first is non-negotiable
- Data usage transparency
- Community and social accountability over individual competition
- Celebrate collective wins (team/squad success)

### 5. **Accessibility**
Ensure gamification works for all:
- Low-bandwidth graphics
- Optional (can disable gamification if preferred)
- Screen reader compatible
- Works across devices (phone, tablet, laptop)
